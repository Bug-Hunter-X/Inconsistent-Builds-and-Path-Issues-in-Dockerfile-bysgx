# Dockerfile Bug: Inconsistent Builds and Path Issues

This repository demonstrates a common but easily avoidable error in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and omitting a working directory.

The original Dockerfile uses the latest version of Ubuntu. This image can change between builds, leading to build inconsistencies as the base image's package versions might shift.

Additionally, the Dockerfile doesn't set a working directory, making it harder to determine the path to your application code and potentially causing errors.
